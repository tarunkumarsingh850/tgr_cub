Odoo Magento 2 Connector
=================================================

Magento Odoo integration is a necessity because the manual entry of data between the two platforms is simply not possible after a certain level of growth, where the data becomes bigger and more complex. Our Odoo-Magento 2 connector app automates your vital business processes and eliminates the need for manual data entry in Odoo by enabling bi-directional data exchange between your Magento 2 and Odoo. Also, this module saves your time by automatically & instantly synchronising your catalogues, orders, customers and inventory data from your online store in Magento 2 to Odoo. After installation of this module, there will be a rare need to login into Magento 2 admin panel for managing business operations. You can manage most of the operations from Odoo itself and that too with integrating inventory with other popular business apps like CRM, Purchase & Accounting.
